Workshop code for RISD STEAM workshop: programming mobile sound - February 1, 2017

**For today's session:**

1. You'll need a laptop (Mac or Windows), mobile device (iOS or Android), and a USB sync cable
2. Download and install Pd 0.47-1 (Pure Data) from <a href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html" target="_blank">http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html</a>.  Put it in your Applications folder (i.e. get it out of your Downloads folder)
3. Download MobMuPlat development package: <a href="http://danieliglesia.com/mobmuplat/" target="_blank">http://danieliglesia.com/mobmuplat/</a>. Make a new working folder on your Desktop and move the MobMuPlat package there (get it out of your Downloads folder)
4. For your mobile device, download MobMuPlat either from iTunes store (iOS) or Google Play store (Android).  It's a free app.
5. For iOS, you'll need iTunes.  For Mac + Android, you can use Android file transfer:  <a href="https://www.android.com/filetransfer/" target="_blank">https://www.android.com/filetransfer/</a>  
6. You'll need the appropriate sync cable for your device.  Alternatively you can transfer files on iOS via AirDrop (without iTunes).
7. If you have Windows + Android, file transfer should be fairly straightforward, we'll figure it out.
