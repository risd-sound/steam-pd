Workshop code for RISD STEAM workshop: programming mobile sound - February 1, 2017

**For today's session:**

1. Download and install Pd 0.47-1 (Pure Data) from http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html
2. Download MobMuPlat development package to your laptop: http://danieliglesia.com/mobmuplat/
3. For your mobile device, download MobMuPlat either from iTunes store (iOS) or Play Store (Android).  It's a free app.
4. For iOS, you'll need iTunes.  For Mac + Android, you can utilize Android file transfer: https://www.android.com/filetransfer/
5. You'll need the appropriate sync cable for your device.  Alternatively you can transfer files on iOS via AirDrop (without iTunes).
6. If you have Windows + Android, file transfer should be straightforward, we'll figure it out.
