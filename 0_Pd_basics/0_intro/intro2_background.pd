#X text 106 91 Pd (Pure Data) is a visual programming language \, sometimes
called a dataflow language. It allows you patch together "objects"
to make your own programs. Each object is a bit of C code that functions
like a "black box machine." When patching \, you only need to worry
about the input and output of these objects (which we could also call
functions and are often called "externals" by the Max & Pd community).
;
#X text 501 343 Pd was created by Miller Puckette in the mid-90s \,
as an open source project. It is a part of a family of patcher programming
languages \, the most famous of which is it's commercial cousin Max/MSP
(Cycling '74). Notably \, Miller is the author of the original Max
program developed in the 1980s. The program 'Max' was named Max Mathews
. Max Mathews' Music N languages were the basis for many of today's
computer music programming languages.;
#X text 52 315 Pd runs in "real-time \, " meaning that you do not need
to compile the program for it to run. In Pd you can be in one of two
modes: edit or run.;
#X text 540 139 There are many objects in the "vanilla" distribution
of Pd. You can even code objects yourself \, so Pd is a great environment
for running your own bits of code. Objects are mostly written in C.
You can also create your own libraries of "abstractions" which are
sub-patches you plan to use alot. These work like objects \, but are
created with Pd.;
